This manual covers safety procedures for all outdoor construction activities including but not limited to: crane operations, scaffolding work, roofing, excavation, and concrete pouring.

1.2 Authority
Site managers and safety officers have the authority to halt any operation that poses safety risks due to weather conditions.

2. WIND SPEED RESTRICTIONS

2.1 Crane Operations
- Maximum allowable wind speed: 20 mph (32 km/h) sustained winds
- Maximum gust speed: 30 mph (48 km/h)
- Operations must cease when winds exceed these thresholds
- Crane boom must be lowered and secured during high wind events

2.2 Scaffolding Work
- Work prohibited when winds exceed 25 mph (40 km/h)
- All materials must be secured when winds exceed 15 mph (24 km/h)
- Scaffolding must be inspected after any wind event exceeding 30 mph

2.3 Roofing Operations
- No roof work when winds exceed 20 mph (32 km/h)
- Special caution required for work above 15 mph
- Workers must use 100% tie-off when winds exceed 10 mph

2.4 Personnel Lifts and Aerial Platforms
- Maximum operating wind speed: 28 mph (45 km/h)
- Work must stop at 25 mph sustained winds
- Ground personnel must monitor wind conditions continuously

3. PRECIPITATION RESTRICTIONS

3.1 Rain
- Light rain (< 2.5mm/hour): Operations may continue with caution
- Moderate rain (2.5-7.5mm/hour): Non-critical operations should pause
- Heavy rain (> 7.5mm/hour): All outdoor work must stop
- 24-hour rainfall exceeding 25mm requires site inspection before resuming work

3.2 Snow and Ice
- Accumulation of 1 inch (25mm) or more requires work stoppage
- Icy conditions on scaffolding or elevated surfaces: No access permitted
- Roof snow load must be monitored; work prohibited if structural concerns exist

3.3 Thunderstorms
- All outdoor work must cease when lightning is within 10 miles (16 km)
- 30-minute wait period after last observed lightning before resuming
- Workers must seek shelter in substantial buildings or hard-topped vehicles

4. TEMPERATURE EXTREMES

4.1 Cold Weather (OSHA Guidelines)
- Work pace must be reduced below 20°F (-6°C)
- Mandatory warm-up breaks every 2 hours below 10°F (-12°C)
- Work prohibited below 0°F (-18°C) without specialized equipment

4.2 Hot Weather
- Increased hydration breaks above 85°F (29°C)
- Work intensity reduced above 90°F (32°C)
- Heat stress monitoring required above 95°F (35°C)

5. VISIBILITY CONDITIONS

5.1 Fog
- Operations requiring crane signals or visual communication: Work prohibited when visibility < 500 feet (150m)
- Vehicle movement restricted when visibility < 1000 feet (300m)

5.2 Dust Storms
- All outdoor work must cease during dust storms
- Eye protection required when dust is present

6. SPECIALIZED OPERATIONS

6.1 Concrete Pouring
- No concrete pouring during rain or when rain is imminent
- Temperature must be above 40°F (4°C) and rising
- Wind chill factor must not bring effective temperature below freezing

6.2 Excavation Work
- Stop work if water accumulation exceeds 6 inches (150mm)
- Monitor for soil saturation after heavy rain (> 12mm in 24 hours)
- Enhanced shoring inspection required after precipitation events

7. SITE PREPARATION AND RESPONSE

7.1 Weather Monitoring
- Sites must have access to current and forecast weather data
- Designate weather monitor for critical lifts and operations
- Weather updates required every 4 hours during active operations

7.2 Emergency Procedures
- Clear evacuation routes must be maintained
- Emergency contact numbers posted prominently
- Site-specific weather emergency plan must be documented

8. DOCUMENTATION

8.1 Weather Logs
- Record weather conditions at start of each shift
- Document any weather-related work stoppages
- Maintain records for minimum 3 years

8.2 Incident Reporting
- All weather-related incidents must be reported within 24 hours
- Near-miss events should be documented for safety review

9. COMPLIANCE

Failure to follow these weather safety protocols may result in:
- Immediate work stoppage
- Safety violations and fines
- Loss of site access privileges
- Termination of employment for serious violations

Remember: WHEN IN DOUBT, STOP WORK AND CONSULT YOUR SUPERVISOR.

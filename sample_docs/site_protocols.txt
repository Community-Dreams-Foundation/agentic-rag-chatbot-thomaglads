- Tower crane operations (primary and secondary cranes)
- High-rise scaffolding systems
- Rooftop mechanical installation areas
- Ground-level staging and material storage

2. ENHANCED WIND PROTOCOLS (Site Alpha Specific)

Due to urban wind tunnel effects and building height:

2.1 Primary Tower Crane (Crane A)
- Normal max wind: 20 mph (per general manual)

- Weathervane mode: Automatic above 25 mph

2.2 Secondary Crane (Crane B)
- Max wind: 20 mph (standard)
- Enhanced inspection after any wind event > 15 mph

2.3 High-Rise Work (Floors 15+)
- Additional 10% wind speed reduction
- Max wind for work above floor 15: 16 mph sustained
- Mandatory safety lines above floor 10 regardless of wind

3. BOSTON-SPECIFIC WEATHER CONSIDERATIONS
